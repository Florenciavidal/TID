I am currently working on modifying an existing notebook called "Avocado Price Optimization" https://www.gurobi.com/jupyter_models/avocado-price-optimization/  that utilizes machine learning to predict demand and the Gurobi solver to optimize the model. This is for a university research workshop (TID). The modifications I have made include transforming the "price" and "units_sold" variables to a logarithmic scale and calculating the price effect for each region to improve the regression and address the optimization problem, ultimately increasing profits. This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to solve real-world problems in the agricultural industry. Within the GitHub repository, you can find the modified notebook and accompanying code, as well as a detailed description of the modifications made and the results achieved.
